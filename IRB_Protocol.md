# Project Summary

The scientific community has increasingly acknowledged the importance of reproducibility and replicability.
Our research project is one of several across the sciences developing reproduction and replication studies, infrastructure to facilitate reproducibility, and curricula to teach reproducibility.
Now, it is time to design workshops and training materials to help raise awareness and capacity for reproducibility and replicability.
The purpose of this research project is to use a series of short online Qualtrics surveys to collect data on workshop participants' engagement with reproducibility and replicability in order to inform future workshop design and outreach.

# Study Site

The site of the study is the Qualtrics survey platform.

# Recruitment and Consent

## Subjects

The target population for this research is potential participants in workshops on reproducibility and replicability at virtual or in-person professional and academic conferences.
Participants are engaged in academic research or teaching and are at the career stage of graduate students or greater.
Participants under the age of 18 are excluded from the study.

## Estimated number of subjects

It is unfortunately not possible to estimate, in advance, the number of participants that will join virtual workshops and agree to participation in the survey.
Theoretically, anyone can register for the Spatial Data Science Symposium (http://sdss2023.spatial-data-science.net/) for free and join our virtual workshop.

## Recruitment

Individuals who are participating in a workshop will be invited to participate  with an announcement and presentation slide at the beginning of a workshop on reproducibility and replicability.
The invitation will include an internet link and QR code to an online Qualtrics survey.
The first page of the survey will contain an informed consent statement followed by a question about the participants' eligibility (being over 18) and interest in participation.

This research project will include two or more workshops.
The first workshop, on September 5, 2023, is a free virtual one-hour workshop in the Spatial Data Science Symposium (http://sdss2023.spatial-data-science.net/), which uses the Airmeet platform (https://www.airmeet.com/).
Registration for the symposium is free, and the symposium organizers have promoted the event on academic electronic discussion boards, e.g. the specialty groups of the American Association of Geographers.
The second workshop, on July 15-16 2024, is an Alliance to Advance Liberal Arts Colleges workshop to be hosted by Middlebury College.
The workshop is promoted by the deans and provosts of all AALAC institutions, and participation is supported by workshop funds and supplemented by the provosts of the participants' institutions.
We will specifically invite participation by email of AALAC faculty members who have previously published scholarship on reproducibility or replicability as determined by a Google Scholar literature search of each institution name combined with "reproducible OR reproducibility OR replicable OR replicability OR '"'open science'", and expanded through the snowball method of outreach and recommendations.

If the research project expands to offer more workshops, we will amend the recruitment information with data on the new workshops.

# Compensation

There is no material compensation for participation.
However, we hope that the participants find the related open license workshop materials and research results useful in their own work.

# Consent

I will obtain electronic informed consent.
Please see consent form.

# Methods

## Project Goals

The goal of the project is to assess workshop effectiveness and inform future workshop and outreach design by answering the following questions about open and reproducible research practices (ORRP):

1. Before the workshop, which ORRP are researchers already familiar with and already using?
2. Before the workshop, to what extent are scholars already integrating ORRP in their research, teaching, and advising?
3. Before the workshop, how likely are participants to integrate ORRP in their scholarship?

We will repeat the survey immediately following the workshop, and again after one academic year has passed.
This will allow us to answer the questions:

1. Has the workshop increased interest in ORRP?
2. Has the workshop increased the likelihood of adopting ORRP?
3. Has the workshop increased the integration of ORRP in research, teaching, and advising?
4. What elements of reproducibility and replicability workshops and outreach need to be prioritized and improved?

## Methods

- [x] Survey, questionnaire, or test.

## Survey distribution and collection details

The survey will be distributed electronically using Qualtrics. The first wave will be distributed with a URL link and QR code link at the beginning of the workshop. The second and third waves will be distributed with email addresses provided by participants in the first survey. Participation is optional and participants can skip questions or close the survey at any time. We will use Qualtrics to link email addresses with unique survey response IDs. The surveys are set to the "AWhen we analyze the data, we use the Qualtrics API and the QualtRics package for R to download the data, de-identify
