## Introduction

- HEGSRR Website **-Navigate to template-**
- Template Repository (Github)
 - This template repository is designed to facilitate researcher adoption of OSRP, and by extension improve R&R of spatial data science and geographic research.
 - **-Scroll readme, Show 1 sub-folder-** Much of the template structure is summarized in this top level readme, and each sub-folder in the template contains instructions on how to use that particular resource.
 - We are also presently developing a manual the demonstrates how to use this template in university courses.
 - However, we thought the best way to familiarize you with the OSRP and how those practices are integrated into and supported by our template structure was to demonstrate that template was deployed to conduct a reproduction study and setup a replication study.
 - In this video, we will focus on the implementation of a reproduction study, but we have used this same template to prepare and track original research. **-Quickly show survey repo-** For example, we have completed two surveys on OSRP use in geography using this template .

## Spielman et al. (2020)
**-Show P1 of Spielman-**
- Motivation: We attempted to reproduce a spatial analysis of the SOVI for 3 reasons:
 1. The paper is an example of a replication study of which there are few in geography,
 2. SOVI is a highly influential model (the original SOVI publication has garnered 7,134 citations).
 3. We wanted to use this as a hands on example to teach undergraduate GIS students OSRP

- Another reason we selected this article is because the authors did make available the data and code used in their analyses.
- You may think that because these authors took the time to share their data and their code in a Github repository that it would be relatively easy to reproduce their results. That was not the case.
- In fact, reproducing this study took significant effort by a faculty member and RA with significant GIS, spatial analysis, and computer science experience.
- The raw materials were available: The paper was well-written and the data and code were available, but the organization of those materials and the tacit knowledge that went into producing the result were missing.
- Our template addresses with these challenges, and makes it easier for other to recreate, assess, and build on your work.

**-Navigate to RPR Report & RPL PAP-**
- Our effort to reproduce Spielman et al. (2020) created many intermediate products, but the two key summary products are a report detailing our reproduction attempt and findings, and a PAP for a subsequent replication attempt that will extend this work.
- For those familiar, you may notice that these .pdf are renderings from Jupyter notebooks where all of our writing and analysis were done together.
- So how did we go about this research, and how did our template support that effort?
