   - Presents the practical framework and associated template for our approach to conducting reproduction and replication studies. Include three example reproductions of spatial analyses of COVID-19, which are linked to completed, open access project repositories.

   - A survey of geographic researchers assessing their understanding of reproducible research and reproducible research practices. Key findings include 1) researchers conflate definitions of reproduction and replication, 2)sub-disciplinary variation in the precieved value of reproduction, and that 3)very few attempt and publish reproduction studies.
