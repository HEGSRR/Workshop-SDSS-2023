## Evaluation

We will conduct a survey at the beginning of the workshop and invite participants to complete a post-workshop survey immediately following the workshop and one academic year later.
The short surveys will establish a baseline of knowledge and interest in open and reproducible research practices and help guide outreach for implementing open and reproducible research practices in new research and teaching programs.
We will share survey results here.

You may read the [informed consent document](assets/IRB_Consent.pdf) for the survey instrument.
